# Better Share Buttons

I created this repository because I want to make it easy to create share buttons for various social media platforms.

Benefits of using this repository are:

- SVG icon are already included.
- Basic CSS styles are already done for you—so the button looks great from the get-go.
- You can easily tweak the buttons further by including your own CSS.

Here's what the buttons look like in action.
